💡 Working:

1. Pose Detection: The system uses a camera (or connected device) to capture the user’s body posture. The pose detection algorithm (such as MediaPipe, OpenPose, or a custom CNN) analyzes the position of key body points like joints and limbs.

2. Pose Comparison: The detected posture is compared against a database of ideal yoga poses. Any deviations or misalignments are identified to ensure the user maintains proper form.

3. Real-Time Feedback: Based on the detected posture, the system provides feedback (visual, audio, or haptic) to correct any misalignments in real time. This helps in preventing injury and ensuring that the user is practicing with proper alignment.

4. Personalized Recommendations: As the user progresses, the system tracks their performance and suggests next poses based on the user’s flexibility, alignment, and session history.

5. Mobile App: The mobile app displays all feedback, progress statistics, and personalized yoga routines. It also helps monitor the user's progress and adapt yoga sessions according to their needs.
